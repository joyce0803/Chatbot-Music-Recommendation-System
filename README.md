# Chatbot-Music-Recommendation-System
A mini project that recommends songs based on the mood of the user


Music is an integral part of our lives. Most social media or music streaming platforms recommend songs based on the user's history and are not very personalized. User's sometimes find it difficult to choose from millions of songs. Thus, there is a need for a good recommendation system. Chatbots nowadays are mainly built for business purposes. This project aims to make an interactive chatbot that one can talk and have casual conversations with. The chatbot is created using 'Chatterbot'. The chatbot will analyze the user's sentiment using the pretrained model 'EmoRoBERTA' and mood based on the conversations and then it will generate a personalized playlist of songs for the user. It can be run on the user’s desktop and its main aim is to reliably determine the user’s mood. This project will implement machine learning and will recommend songs using the Spotify API. Python is used as the prime language as it supports an extensive set of open source libraries which can be used to build the project. Flask is used to design the application.
